Live Demo: <https://pmoosi.github.io/LibraryApiDemo/index.html>

Go to <https://libraryapi.paulmoosbrugger.com/signUpClient> to create a client or to <https://libraryapi.paulmoosbrugger.com/signUpLibrary> to create a library

There are already two test-user:  
un: client@libraryapi.com, pw: test

### Usage

The demo has to be run on a server, else the login can't redirect.
